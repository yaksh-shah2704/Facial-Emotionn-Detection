😊 Facial Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

This project detects human facial emotions using deep learning. It starts with a custom facial emotion dataset containing training and testing images, builds a CNN model for classification, evaluates accuracy, and finally uses the best model for real-time emotion detection that predicts the user's mood.


📌 Project Highlights

  - 🗂️ Used a dataset with labeled emotions (Training & Testing folders)
  - 🧠 Built a CNN model from scratch for emotion classification
  - 📈 Achieved ~48% training accuracy and lower testing accuracy initially
  - 🎯 Improved the model with better architecture & preprocessing
  - 😎 Final model predicts real-time **mood** via webcam

🛠️ Tech Stack

  - Python 🐍<br>
  - TensorFlow / Keras<br>
  - OpenCV<br>
  - NumPy & Pandas<br>
  - Matplotlib (for plotting accuracy/loss)<br>

🧠 Emotions Detected
  Happy 😀<br>
  Sad 😢<br>
  Angry 😠<br>
  Surprise 😮<br>
  Neutral 😐

📊 Model Performance<h3>
Initial model accuracy: 48% on training set<br>
Final model: Improved predictions with better preprocessing & tuning<br>
Final output: Detects and displays mood based on facial emotion<br>
